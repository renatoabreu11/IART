# IART
Repository to host Artificial Intelligence project.

IART is a course given at FEUP in the third year of the Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering.
 
## Goal
The goal of this project is to, in a given city, identify the best route to be followed by a group of waste collection trucks, minimizing the route taken and maximizing the load transported

## Description
wasteManagement.Truck.Waste collection is a daily task in a city that must be performed as efficiently as possible, either to keep the city clean or to minimize the associated costs. In order to transport waste to the treatment plants, the city services maintain a fleet of specialized trucks which carry out collection routes, which are defined a priori and carried out systematically at a given frequency.

This collection is intended to be extremely optimized. In fact, the containers scattered in various parts of the city, where the residents deposit the garbage, may not be full enough to justify emptying them by the collection truck, which would make some trips unnecessary. With sensor networks technology developing rapidly, a more effective monitoring of the level of waste accumulation in each container is already possible.

In this work, we intend to develop an application that determines the collection routes to be made by trucks, considering only the containers with sufficient residue that justifies their collection. It is suggested the best route (minimization of the distance traveled and maximization of the load) from the central, where the trucks are stationed, to the treatment stations, where all the collected waste is deposited.
